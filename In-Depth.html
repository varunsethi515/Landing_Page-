                        ‚ÄúBusiness professional‚Äù was the standard dress code of any office worker up through the 1980s, at which point the 1990s stepped in with the widespread adoption of business casual.
                        <br>
                        However, it‚Äôs far from gone and some may even argue that it‚Äôs making a comeback! Although workplaces may continue to relax their dress codes, employees are beginning to gain a renewed interest in more formal outfitting.
