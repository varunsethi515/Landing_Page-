                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <h3>Good leads are everything !!</h3>
                    <p>Lead are  persons who indicates interest in a company's product or service in some way, shape, or form.</p>
                   
                    <p>Leads typically hear from a business or organization after opening communication (by submitting personal information for an offer, trial, or subscription) … instead of getting a random cold call from someone who purchased their contact information.</p>               
                    <p>Let's say you take an online survey to learn more about how to take care of your car. A day or so later, you receive an email from the auto company that created the survey about how they could help you take care of your car. This process would be far less intrusive than if they'd just called you out of the blue with no knowledge of whether you even care about car maintenance, right? This is what it's like to be a lead.</p>               
                    <p>And from a business perspective, the information the auto company collects about you from your survey responses helps them personalize that opening communication to address your existing problems — and not waste time calling leads who aren't at all interested in auto services.</p>             
                    <p>Leads are part of the broader lifecycle that consumers follow when they transition from visitor to customer. Not all leads are created equal (nor are they qualified the same). There are different types of leads based on how they are qualified and what lifecycle stage they're in.</p>                
                    <p>IN Simple words Without leads there is no business . Leads are the backbone of Every business & mostly business owners or companies face struggled to generate quality leads so here BPA helps we Are the Master Of This field We have best professionals of lead generations.</p>
                    <p><span>YOU BECOME THE PART OF BPA THEN YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT LEADS</span></p>
